### A Shadowrun 5 RPG Toolkit 

I am trying to setup a web based toolkit for the Shadowrun pen and paper role playing game. The rules of this game are extraordinarily complicated and as a game master you need all the help you can get. 

The website isn't online just yet and there is a lot to do before it is going to launch. The idea behind the toolkit is a collection of usefull little apps to help you in designing and running a Shadowrun game session. The first tool i'm working on is a character generator for the GM. It is going to provide you with NPCs (attributes, skills and equipment) at a single klick.

What else tools are going to come is to be seen.
